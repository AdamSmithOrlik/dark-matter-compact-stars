    "The goal of this research is to develop the theory of dark matter compact stars in a simple particle physics realization of the dark sector including a single massive boson.\n",

Doing so will give the mass and denisty of compact objects. \n",

Following [Chang et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07000.pdf) we can define an analogous quantity to the cooling rate given by Eq. 40, where instead we substitue Stefan-Boltzman relation for a black body. \n",
